# Zrunner
Zrunner is a GCC/G++ code runner that simplifies the command for you. It also handles the output file. It compiles the code, runs it and deletes the file.
## But why!!!
Although there are other tools for this job, this project is intended to make you learning phase a little less complex.
## How?!
Just clone the repository or download the code. Then run the zrunnerctl.
```
//to install
zrunnerctl -S
```

```
//to uninstall
zrunnerctl -R
```
